		The old man hunched over a wooden statue, gently creating a new line in its face with a mallet and chisel. His eyes were sunken and heavy as he leaned further forward in order to find a new angle. Normally, he would hear the sound of firecrackers and drum beats as his neighbours celebrated Chinese New Year. Fortunes would be told, dances and parties would be held in the streets. During these times he would usually stay inside. He always stayed inside. Constant work was one of the few things he had left in his life. The rhythm of hammer and chisel on wood had a calming effect on him. It anchored him back to reality. 
		Sometimes, he would look up from his work to see the firecrackers and dancers in the street. The lion dance would be performed, the big paper head turning to and fro to the musicâ€™s intoxicating rhythm. Soon after there would be fireworks. A thousand new stars would light up the sky before falling to earth. The crowd would cheer, and the demons of the past would be driven away. A new year would be ushered in, and hope would return to the community. His wife had always loved the festivities. The brightness. The music.
		Oh to see her again. Even amid the firecrackers and music, she was the most festive thing in the room. Her smile lit up the night sky brighter than the moon itself.  Her laugh was like the tinkling of a thousand silver bells. When she was around, he saw nothing else but her. She was the only thing that ever mattered. 
		He sighed. How he wished she was here with him. But she was dead. Death had taken her early. Now everything was silent. Her laughter was silenced. Her eyes shone no longer. He gave the wooden statue a final polish. It was no longer a faceless figurine, it now had kind, mirthful eyes and a laughing mouth. He looked at it fondly. Ah, my love, I will join you soon. He thought to himself, feeling time and regret hang upon him like a lead jacket. All around him a chill wind blew, filling the streets with ghostly music.
