		<p>
		The sun has set and night prevails, under the moonlight you stood by me with a smile. "Play for me?" You'd ask, your voice echoing in its soft melody and I'd... oblige.
		Our song is one of familiarity; have we not been in touch since we wore silken robes and sparred with bamboo blades? And when I finish, you would look at me with such tender eyes that I could not seem to distinguish.
		I like to believe, I knew how your eyes linger. How a brush of a hand was enough to make the tips of your ears red. Maybe I've always known, what that feeling was. Had I said something, would you have stayed? Would you still be by my side, with a carefree smile on your face?
		I wish not to find out.	The ghost of your hand on mine as the Shogun neared her Musou no Hitotachi keeps me up at night. One last song, I promised you. And I intend to fulfill it. Promise me, we meet again. I would like to give you a proper response, and say yes...
